function sum(){
    return a+b;
}


Okay, I've reviewed the code snippet you provided:

```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

Here's what I've found and some suggestions:

**Issues:**

* **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope or in the surrounding
scope. This will lead to errors (likely `ReferenceError`) when the function is executed. JavaScript doesn't
automatically know what `a` and `b` are supposed to be.
* **Lack of Parameters:** The function doesn't accept any arguments. If you intend to sum two numbers, it needs to
receive those numbers as input.
* **Missing Semicolon:** While JavaScript can often infer semicolons, it's best practice to explicitly include them at
the end of statements to avoid potential issues with automatic semicolon insertion (ASI).

**Suggestions:**

Here's the most common and best way to fix this, assuming you want a function that adds two numbers provided as
arguments:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parameters:** I've added `a` and `b` as parameters to the `sum` function. This means you can now call the function
like this: `sum(5, 3)` to add 5 and 3.
2. **Scope:** The variables `a` and `b` are now defined within the function's scope because they are parameters.
3. **Return Value:** The `return` statement sends the result of `a + b` back to where the function was called.
4. **Semicolon:** I've added the semicolon at the end of the `return` statement for good practice.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
let result = sum(10, 5); // result will be 15
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

**Alternative Scenarios (Less Common, But Possible):**

* **If `a` and `b` are intended to be global variables:**

```javascript
let a = 5; // Example global variable
let b = 3; // Example global variable

function sum() {
return a + b;
}

console.log(sum()); // Output: 8
```

**Important Considerations for Global Variables:**

* **Avoid excessive use of globals.** Global variables can make code harder to reason about and debug. They can lead to
naming conflicts and unexpected side effects if multiple parts of your code modify them.
* **If you *must* use globals,** make sure they are clearly named and documented to avoid confusion.

**In summary:** The best solution depends on your intended use case. However, for a general-purpose sum function, using
parameters is the recommended approach. It makes the function more flexible, reusable, and easier to understand. Always
try to avoid global variable as much as possible
